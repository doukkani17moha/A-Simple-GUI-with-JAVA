# Java GUI Project with Login, Signup, and Database Interaction

This Java project demonstrates a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application with a login and signup system. After successful login, the application allows users to add personal information to a database, display data in a table, delete rows, and export data to a file.

## Features

- **Login Interface:** Users can log in with their credentials.

- **Signup Interface:** New users can create an account.

- **Data Input Interface:** After login, users can add their information (nom, prenom, age) to the database.

- **Data Display Interface:** Users can view data from the database in a table.

- **Data Deletion:** Users can delete entries by selecting a row in the table.

- **Data Export:** Export data from the database to a file.

## Technologies Used

- Java Swing: for building the graphical user interface.
- JDBC: for connecting to and interacting with the database.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
- An SQL database (e.g., MySQL) installed.
